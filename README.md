## Zoom Image

A little yet powerful framework agnostic headless library to zoom images on the web. It is a typical experience on
e-commerce sites. Examples are written with Preact, React, Svelte, Vanilla JS and Vue.

- âœ… Zoom on wheel (scroll & pinch)
- âœ… Zoom on hover
- âœ… Zoom on move
- âœ… Zoom on click

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willnguyen1312/zoom-image
cd zoom-image
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Commands

Please change all versions from "latest" to "workspace\*" inside the example project you want to start, run pnpm install
before executing one of the commands below. I wanted to keep those packages for Stackblitz usage so I use "latest",
unfortunately pnpm doesn't understand it during local development ðŸ™ˆ
